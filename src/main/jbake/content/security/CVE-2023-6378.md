Vulnerability [CVE-2023- 6378](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6378) was
reported against the Logback project. This vulnerability exposes applications to "a potential
denial of service (DOS) attack on a centralized logback receiver when a third party controlling a
remote appender connects to said receiver and could shut down or slow down logging of events". 

The [Sling Commons Log bundle](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-commons-log/) wraps
logback-core and logback-classic, but does not allow arbitrary modifications to the logback.xml file
and is therefore not vulnerable by default to the DOS attack. Applications that programatically
configure Logback might be affected.

The Apache Sling PMC has released [version 5.5.0 of the Sling CommonsLog bundle](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310710&version=12354154&styleName=Text)
which contains a fix for applications that use custom Logback feature vulnerable to this CVE. This
version upgrades to Logback version 1.2.13 and sets the minimum Java version requirement to 11, in
line with the [upstream CVE fix](https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/bb095154be011267b64e37a1d401546e7cc2b7c3).

The Apache Sling PMC recommends that developers and operators of applications built on top of
Apache Sling upgrade to the latest version of the Sling Commons bundle.
